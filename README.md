Process of creating the project.

1.) Create a repository in Github. Keep "gitignore = None". 

2.) Click "Set up in Desktop". This should open GitHub Desktop. 

3.) Keep "Repository URL" the same.

4.) Local Path allows you to place the new folder where you would like to.

5.) Once you made the new folder and pressed "clone". Open VS Code with a new window open.

6.) Click "Open Folder". Find the folder you created from Desktop and open it.

7.) Now that you opened the project folder. Open the VS terminal. Make sure you are using command 
    prompt and not powershell.

8.) In the terminal, type "npm create vite@latest ./". This creates a folder that can use React 
    inside the folder you have open. 

9.) Confirm or change package name to your liking.

10.) Confirm "React" in the dropdown inside the terminal.

11.) After entering React, another dropdown will appear in the terminal, enter "JavaScript".

12.) Once that is done you next command in the terminal should be "npm install". 

13.) Once that finishes, type another command in the terminal, "npm run dev". This opens a tab 
      in your browser for your local host which shows you the page you are working on.
